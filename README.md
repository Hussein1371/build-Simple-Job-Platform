     $db = 'job_platform';
     $user = 'root';
     $pass = ''; // Add your password if necessary
     $port = 3307; // Adjust your MySQL port if different
     $charset = 'utf8mb4';

     $dsn = "mysql:host=$host;dbname=$db;port=$port;charset=$charset";
     try {
         $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass);
         $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
     } catch (PDOException $e) {
